# Quizzlet Remake
I chose to make a stripped down version of Quizzlet because for project 1, someone made memory match and animated their cards flipping. I wanted to make something that had action like that, while still staying manageable to create amidst low motivation.

## Stretch Goals
Theres a few things I would like to add to my website to make it more functionally complete

1. **Allow for better categorization and organization of the quiz cards**
    * Creating a "subject" or "class" which contains a set of cards for more focused studying.
2. **More styling**
    * The current styling on the site is for MVP, there are many small improvements that could be made for a more sleek user experience
